<P>Welcome to the fantastic 2-player card game called "Lost Cities", invented by the prolific German game designer <A HREF="http://freespace.virgin.net/chris.lawson/rk/index.htm" TARGET=_BLANK>Reiner Knizia</A>.  The game will appear shortly in a separate window.  At the moment, you can only play against the computer (and a pretty weak game it plays too).  Future enhancements may include human-human games, possibly a player ladder and a high score table.</P>
<P>I wrote this on-line game as an exercise in Java.  Because the game uses some of the newer  features of Java*, and because most browsers do not yet implement those features, you may be prompted to download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Sun's web site.  This will be a one-off process. If the JRE is already installed, the game will start up straight away.   If the download process does not start automatically, you can find the JRE <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.</P>
<P>Instructions on how to play the game and how to use my program can be found via the Help menu in the game window. If you discover any bugs or have any suggestions on how the program or the computer's play could be improved, please <A HREF="mailto:andrewswan@ozemail.com.au">email me</A>.</P>
<P>Lost Cities is a game of very simple rules but fascinating depth - enjoy!</P>
<P>If you would like to buy a real copy of the Lost Cities card game, please try any of <A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~andrewswan/board/boardgame_buy.htm">these game sellers</A>.</P>
<P>(* namely the Swing GUI components, for those who are interested)</P>
